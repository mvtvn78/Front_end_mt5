[00:00.31] I miss the taste of a sweeter life
[00:04.24] I miss the conversation
[00:08.28] I'm searching for a song tonight
[00:12.50] I'm changing all of the stations
[00:16.48] I like to think that we had it all
[00:20.39] We drew a map to a better place
[00:24.35] But on that road, I took a fall
[00:28.34] Oh baby, why did you run away?
[00:31.29] I was there for you in your darkest times
[00:35.44] I was there for you in your darkest night
[00:39.31] But I wonder, where were you?
[00:41.89] When I was at my worst down on my knees
[00:45.85] And you said you had my back
[00:47.32] So I wonder, where were you?
[00:49.62] When all the roads you took came back to me
[00:53.44] So I'm following the map that leads to you
[00:56.68] The map that leads to you
[00:58.94] Ain't nothing I can do
[01:00.88] The map that leads to you
[01:02.14] Following, following, following to you
[01:05.04] The map that leads to you
[01:06.89] Ain't nothing I can do

[01:10.55] Following, following, following
[01:12.34] I hear your voice in my sleep at night
[01:16.41] Hard to resist temptation
[01:20.23] 'Cause something strange has come over me
[01:23.46] Now, I can't get over you
[01:27.35] No, I just can't get over you
[01:31.35] I was there for you in your darkest times
[01:35.50] I was there for you in your darkest night
[01:39.46] But I wonder, where were you?
