[00:00.00] Maroon 5 ~ Daylight
[00:00.73] Here I am waiting, I'll have to leave soon
[00:04.71] Why am I holding on?
[00:09.03] We knew this day would come, we knew it all along
[00:12.74] How did it come so fast?
[00:15.90] This is our last night but it's late
[00:21.84] And I'm trying not to sleep
[00:25.86] 'Cause I know, when I wake
[00:29.82] I will have to slip away
[00:35.71] And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
[00:39.84] But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
[00:43.67] 'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
[00:47.87] But tonight I need to hold you so close
[00:52.09] Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
[01:00.22] Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
[01:08.74] Here I am staring at your perfection
[01:12.77] In my arms, so beautiful
[01:16.91] The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out
[01:20.71] Somebody slow it down
[01:23.90] This is way too hard
[01:27.91] 'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
[01:31.87] I will leave, this is my last glance
[01:37.76] That will soon be memory
[01:41.73] And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
[01:45.82] But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
[01:49.67] 'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
[01:53.98] But tonight I need to hold you so close
[01:58.11] Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
[02:06.17] Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
[02:15.00] I never wanted to stop
[02:16.99] Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
[02:23.02] I was afraid of the dark
[02:24.93] But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want
[02:33.46] And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
[02:37.87] But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
[02:41.72] 'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
[02:45.88] But tonight I need to hold you so close
[02:49.71] And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
[02:53.87] But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
[02:57.66] 'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
[03:01.95] But tonight I need to hold you so close
[03:06.16] Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
[03:14.19] Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
[03:22.18] Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah)
[03:30.28] Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa
